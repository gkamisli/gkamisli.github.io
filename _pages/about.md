I am Gul Kamisli and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [CaliberAI](https://www.calibermediaworks.com/), where we tackle with defamatory and toxic texts to attain cleaner and safe publishing materials with the aid of Machine Learning methods. I have developed a Recursive Neural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network using LSTM networks and hierarchical attention mechanism aiming to classify texts and provide explainability for the classification. I obtained my BSc degree in Industrial Engineering and BA degree in Economics from [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), Istanbul (Turkey), and completed my MSc degree in Computer Science from [University of Oxford](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Professor Paul Goldberg and Dr. Alejo Nevado-Holgado.
